# Hubitat Exporter

This is a basic [Prometheus] exporter for the [Hubitat] Elevation.

## Installation

Follow the Hubitat [How to Install Custom Apps] documentation.

## Configuration

One the exporter is installed, there are a few basic pieces of configuration
available in the app settings screen. There are:

  - Device Selection
  - Debug Logging

You will need to select devices to make them available to the exporter,
otherwise you will only see basic information about the Hubitat Elevation
itself and not about the connected devices.
